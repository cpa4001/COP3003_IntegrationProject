# COP3003_IntegrationProject
An application that offers a project management tool to create and track user stories for teams that use AGILE methodologies. A user story is a description of a feature for an application that is usually less than three sentences long. The collection of user stories for a product is called the product backlog and this can be broken down to releases, and releases can be broken down to short iterations called sprints. This project is designed to make creating, tracking, and allocating user stories to sprints simple and easy.

A basic layout for a user story looks like: <br>
As a who      (**Who** wants to accomplish something) <br>
I want a what (**What** I want to accomplish)         <br>
So that       (**Why** I want to accomplish)          <br>

Users will be able to:
- create user stories
- look at created stories
